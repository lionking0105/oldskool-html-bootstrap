## Demo

**Please note that this is an HTML template only. It does not connect to a database, and will not automatically work in a content management system (Wordpress etc). You will need to incorporate our code into your application.**

## Template Pages
The template consists of 3 pages:

* Homepage
* Category page
* Product page

To keep code repetition to a minimum, we've used Handlebars.js as the templating engine and partials to quickly add new pages or the same sections to all pages. We also use a Handlebars plugin for JSON data - this allows us to use loops and output a single HTML code block instead of repeating the same HTML.


## OldSkool Key Features
In addition to all the Bootstrap components and features, OldSkool also offers the following custom components:

* Homepage slideshow (using Swiper.js)

## Bootstrap Documentation
Bootstrap already has a comprehensive documentation site that will guide you in setting up and using all default Bootstrap features. Although our template helpdocs will include some default Bootstrap setup, please refer to Bootstrap's doc site first for any default Bootstrap features: [Visit Bootstrap's Doc Site](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)

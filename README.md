# OldSkool - Bootstrap 5 HTML Responsive Template

## Overview
OldSkool is the perfect starting point for your next fashion retail website. This flexible and modern Bootstrap 5 template offers a clean and minimal design, customisable listing cards for the category page, and a simple yet elegant product page to beautifully display your products. 

## Template Pages
The template consists of 3 pages:

* Homepage

More pages can quickly and easily be added. The source code using Handlebars.js as the templating language, and we've used Handlebars partials to keep code repetition to a minimum.

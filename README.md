## Template Pages
The template consists of 3 pages:

* Homepage
* Category page
* Product page

To keep code repetition to a minimum, we've used Handlebars.js as the templating engine and partials to quickly add new pages or the same sections to all pages. We also use a Handlebars plugin for JSON data - this allows us to use loops and output a single HTML code block instead of repeating the same HTML.

## Demo
[Demo](http://example.com/)

**Please note that this is an HTML template only. It does not connect to a database, and will not automatically work in a content management system (Wordpress etc). You will need to incorporate our code into your application.**

## Template Pages
The template consists of 3 pages:

* Homepage
* Category page
* Product page

To keep code repetition to a minimum, we've used Handlebars.js as the templating engine and partials to quickly add new pages or the same sections to all pages. We also use a Handlebars plugin for JSON data - this allows us to use loops and output a single HTML code block instead of repeating the same HTML.


## OldSkool Key Features

## Bootstrap Documentation
Bootstrap already has a comprehensive documentation site that will guide you in setting up and using all default Bootstrap features. Please refer to Bootstrap's doc site first for any default Bootstrap features: [Visit Bootstrap's Doc Site](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)

## File structure
📁 dist - Generated version of the template. Go here if you do not want to work with the template source code. But be warned: if you customise anything in this folder directly, and then later recompile the template using webpack, unless you move the dist folder out of the template, your changes will be overridden.
📁 node_modules - Directory where NPM installs dependancies. You will not see this folder until you complete the template installation. You do not need to create this folder.
📁 src - Template source code. Go here to customise your template.

📁 assets - Template assets such as CSS, JS, Images etc.

📁 data - Template JSON Data files. We use these JSON files to make your job easier to insert content into the template. 

📁 html - Template pages. Go here to edit existing pages or add new pages.

📁 partials - Handlebars partial templates.
